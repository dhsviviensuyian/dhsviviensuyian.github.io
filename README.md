Other than that I also like Kpop.I listen to their songs during my free time. Although I may not understand what they are saying but somehow I enjoy it. Sometimes I can get what they are saying and other times I probably use subtitles. My favourite Kpop groups are Exo, BLACKPINK and Got7. I like their concepts and their personalities.They can be really cool and fierce on stage but in real life they are just like us.
